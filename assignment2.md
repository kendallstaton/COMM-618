To editor: 

Virginia underwent significant changes in the education system under the leadership of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who focused in on overhauling the assessment system towards the end of his term. The state board of education, filled completely with Youngkin appointees, has taken steps to lower the "honesty" gap in student assessment scores, which is the difference in proficiency on state exams versus national exams. 

The point of those changes are to create a more educated youth across the state. So, how do dropout rates differ from the start of Youngkin's administration to now? That data is tracked by the state Department of Education. The information is broken down by school, race and gender. 

The definition of a dropout is unclear in this dataset, so it would need to be confirmed with the Board of Education. This is school level data, so there is a chance for variance if there is no statewide dropout definition. This needs to be clarified with further reporting. 

Datasets are available online back to the 2001-2002 school year. 

Further, an analysis of what school districts and counties face the largest dropout rates would be interesting to see. Do they match basic assumptions – like poorer districts having higher dropout rates? – or does the data defy? Analysis of the data could lead to further conversations with elected leaders about deliverance on campaign promises to bolster public education across Virginia.

# Leaf blowers are banned, but they’re still causing a ruckus
By: Kendall Staton

More than half of the noise complaints filed in Montgomery County, Maryland last year related to the use of gas powered leaf blowers despite a county-wide ban on the tools.

Data from Montgomery County Maryland’s Department of Environmental Protection shows that Maryland's most populous county received 1,058 total noise complaints in 2025, with 669 of those reports related to the use or sale of gas-powered leaf blowers. 

The number of leaf blower noise complaints last year is more than the total number of noise complaints filed with the county’s Department of Environmental Protection in 2024, which rang in at 442.

But just because the use of leaf blowers was reported more last year doesn’t necessarily mean Montgomery County has gotten exponentially louder. The sharp jump could be attributed to people more consistently reporting the noise, rather than the actual use of the tools increasing.

Nearly 90% of leaf-blower noise complaints in 2025 were filed after July 1, which is when the county government implemented the ban on gas-powered leaf blowers.

Prior to 2025, complaints related to leaf blowers were filed as “industrial/commercial noise.” Last year, that changed to count the complaints in their own categories, “leaf blower use” and “leaf blower sales.” Sales of gas powered leaf blowers were banned in July 2024. 

Complaints are submitted by ZIP code, with Potomac's 20854 bringing in 84 noise complaints related to leaf blowers. The area had 97 total noise complaints, the most of any ZIP code in 2025. 

The prior year, the ZIP code, which encompasses all of Potomac, only had 19 total submissions, only one of which related to the noise from a leaf blower. 

Below is a chart showing the distribution of the five area codes with the highest number of noise complaints in 2025.

Note:
I cleaned the data first by pulling out the information for 2025. Then I split the complaint type on the original file into two seperate columns -- complaint type and complaint sub type. That made it easier to understand the different values. Instead of two different notations in one column, like "industrial -- equiptment noise," i could isolate them. I also fixed a typo in the data which referred to "multi tenant" residential units as "muti tenant." There we also two different denotations for electrical amplification complaints, so I made that language more consistent (one was El Amplification Equip and one was Electrical Amp Equip). If a real report, I would call and make sure these aren't really two distincit things before publication. I used a few different pivot tables to take a look at the distribution of noise complaints across the county, and compared by year. I was most interested to figure out what the loudest areas of the county are, but then saw the interesting piece about the leaf blowers and decided to stick with that. 

This was a bit difficult for me -- I worked on it for six hours which felt a bit excessive. So the table with just 2025 data is super clean and work I would be comfortable to publish. The full copy of data is less clean becuase I didn't spend as much time on it -- mostly went backt to look at year by year comparisons here which I wasn't planning to do. In the future I'll think a bit more clearly at the beginning and make sure I have enough time to clean all the data I'm looking at 100% properly. (I think there were a few odd splits in the multi year spreadsheet, but I was only looking at totals here so I didnt feel the need to spend the time and spruce those up.)

Here's a link to my spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dYc7ZaYAJyX_ZAXhBchAAR8OsGEYhCVomS071KvT8G8/edit?usp=sharing

Also would love if we could talk a bit more in class about blank cells. There were a few cells in my data that were blank, and I wasn't quite sure how to handle those. I understand a completely blank row needs to be dealt with differently, but at what point are blank cells intefering with the useability of the data? I can ask this in class, but just wanted to bring it up ahead of time!

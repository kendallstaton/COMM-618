# Leaf blowers are banned, but they’re still causing a ruckus

More than half of the noise complaints filed in Montgomery County, Maryland last year related to the use of gas powered leaf blowers despite a county-wide ban on the tools.

Data from Montgomery County Maryland’s Department of Environmental Protection shows that Maryland's most populous county received 1,058 total noise complaints in 2025, with 669 of those reports related to the use or sale of gas-powered leaf blowers. 

The number of leaf blower noise complaints last year is more than the total number of noise complaints filed with the county’s Department of Environmental Protection in 2024, which rang in at 442.

But just because the use of leaf blowers was reported more last year doesn’t necessarily mean Montgomery County has gotten exponentially louder. The sharp jump could be attributed to people more consistently reporting the noise, rather than the actual use of the tools increasing.

Nearly 90% of leaf-blower noise complaints in 2025 were filed after July 1, which is when the county government implemented the ban on gas-powered leaf blowers.

Prior to 2025, complaints related to leaf blowers were filed as “industrial/commercial noise.” Last year, that changed to count the complaints in their own categories, “leaf blower use” and “leaf blower sales.” Sales of gas powered leaf blowers were banned in July 2024. 

Complaints are submitted by ZIP code, with Potomac's 20854 bringing in 84 noise complaints related to leaf blowers. The area had 97 total noise complaints, the most of any ZIP code in 2025. 

The prior year, the ZIP code, which encompasses all of Potomac, only had 19 total submissions, only one of which related to the noise from a leaf blower.

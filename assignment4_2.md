As the new season of the popular show Bridgerton airs on Netflix, audiences from around the world are locked on the screen. The drama follows the regal Birdgerton family through the trials and tribulations of familial matters and the marriage mart, where young women set out to find their husbands. But, perhaps the most relevant cultrual part of the show is the regency fashion reemergence. The costuming in Bridgerton calls upon the fashion of the 1800s, though is not entirealy period accurate. Nonetheless, online chatter praises the ballgowns of the young women in the show week after week. So, what are the characters in the show actually wearing? Is there a color most prominenet that could potentiall point us to upcoming trends in the fashion cycle? As we head into summer and get ready for the new trend cycles, an analysis of populat TV fashion would give us a leg up in quick predictions of the hottest fashion we'll see this year. At the very least, this anaylsis will answer the question: What type of clothing do we see most often on Bridgerton?

To collect the data, I will watch all currently available episodes of Bridgerton on Netflix. That's three complete seasons with a new weekly episode dropping for season four currently. Analysis will focus on the current season and how the clothing differs from what we've seen on the screen before. I will track the color, cut, and sleeve length for each outfit in every episode worn by the main women of the season.

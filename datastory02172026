This is one of the most important stories happening in the U.S. right now. I think the information is really interesting, but I don't like the main illustration. The tree map is very confusing and not a very clear way of presenting the information. 
  I think it would make sense as a graphic later in the story. It's visually jarring. I'd like to hear a bit more about the decision to go with this organization. 
  But, I do like the single sentence presentation. It's one of the more engaging ways to make sure people are actually reading the information.

Dear Ms. Hall:
Under the Kentucky Open Records Act § 61.872 et seq., I am requesting an opportunity to inspect or obtain copies of public records that show the use and distribution of Council District Capital Funds for each of the 15 city council members on Lexington’s council. Please include records for fiscal years 2021-2026, including partial designations for the current fiscal year. 
If there are any fees for searching or copying these records, please inform me if the cost will exceed $50.  However, I would also like to request a waiver of all fees in that the disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to the public’s understanding of the use of public funds. I am a member of the news media and his request is related to newsgathering efforts. This information is not being sought for commercial purposes.
The Kentucky Open Records Act requires a response time within five business days.  If access to the records I am requesting will take longer than that time period, please contact me with information about when I might expect copies or the ability to inspect the requested records.
If you deny any or all of this request, please cite each specific exemption you feel justifies the refusal to release the information and notify me of the appeal procedures available to me under the law.
Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,
Kendall Staton

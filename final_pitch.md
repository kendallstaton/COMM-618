A break down of the queerness of elected officials across the nation. Kentucky has more queer officials per capita than New York. There's many ways to go with this data, but I ultimately want to tell a story. I plan to interview some of the more contridictory names on the list of queer officials -- queer officials in Texas or Kentucky, a republican queer elected official, the first trans woman in congress, etc. 
Out For America has declined to provide me a csv file of the data, so I will have to input into google sheets myself. They have however agreed to an interview about data collection and methodology. News peg is perhaps the fact that there are currently the highest number of queer officials in the U.S. ever, yet they still only makes up a quarter of one percent of the total number of elected officials.

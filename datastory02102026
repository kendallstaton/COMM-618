I love language studies and this analysis of words used to describe different bodies of water is really interesting. I'd like to know a little bit more about the actual linguistics of how areas choose to classify these bodies of water. Are areas of the onctinent first colonized by Spain more likely to use a specific term? I think the general analysis is intetesting, but I will always want to know why there is such a difference from region to region.
